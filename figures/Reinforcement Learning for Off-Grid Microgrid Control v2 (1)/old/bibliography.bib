abstract = {A novel energy management system (EMS) based on a rolling horizon (RH) strategy for a renewable-based microgrid is proposed. For each decision step, a mixed integer optimization problem based on forecasting models is solved. The EMS provides online set points for each generation unit and signals for consumers based on a demand-side management (DSM) mechanism. The proposed EMS is implemented for a microgrid composed of photovoltaic panels, two wind turbines, a diesel generator and an energy storage system. A coherent forecast information scheme and an economic comparison framework between the RH and the standard unit commitment (UC) are proposed. Solar and wind energy forecasting are based on phenomenological models with updated data. A neural network for two-day-ahead electric consumption forecasting is also designed. The system is tested using real data sets from an existent microgrid in Chile (ESUSCON). The results based on different operation conditions show the economic sense of the proposal. A full practical implementation of the system for ESUSCON is envisioned.},

abstract = {Microgrids are a rapidly growing sector of smart grids, which will be an essential component in the trend toward distributed electricity generation. In the operation of a microgrid, forecasting the short-term load is an important task. With a more accurate short-term loaf forecast (STLF), the microgrid can enhance the management of its renewable and conventional resources and improve the economics of energy trade with electricity markets. However, STLF for microgrids is a complex forecast process, mainly because of the highly nonsmooth and nonlinear behavior of the load time series. In this paper, characteristics of the load time series of a typical microgrid are discussed and the differences with the load time series of traditional power systems are described. In addition, a new bilevel prediction strategy is proposed for STLF of microgrids. The proposed strategy is composed of a feature selection technique and a forecast engine (including neural network and evolutionary algorithm) in the lower level as the forecaster and an enhanced differential evolution algorithm in the upper level for optimizing the performance of the forecaster. The effectiveness of the proposed prediction strategy is evaluated by the real-life data of a university campus in Canada. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

@article{Parisio2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. Microgrids are subsystems of the distribution grid operating as a single controllable system either connected or isolated from the grid. In this paper, a novel cooperative model predictive control (MPC) framework is proposed for urban districts comprising multiple microgrids sharing certain distributed energy resources (DERs). The operation of the microgrids, along with the shared DER, are coordinated such that the available flexibility sources are optimised and a common goal is achieved, e.g., minimizing energy exchanged with the distribution grid and the overall energy costs. Each microgrid is equipped with an MPC-based energy management system, responsible for optimally controlling flexible loads, heating systems, and local generation devices based on end-user preferences, weather-dependent generation and demand forecasts, energy prices, and technical and operational constraints. The proposed coordination algorithm is distributed and guarantees constraints satisfaction, cooperation among microgrids and fairness in the use of the shared resources, while addressing the issue of scalability of energy management in an urban district. Furthermore, the proposed framework guarantees an agreed cost saving to each microgrid. The described method is implemented and evaluated in a virtual testing environment that integrates accurate simulators of the microgrids. Numerical experiments show the feasibility, the computational benefits, and the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {We consider a microgrid for energy distribution, with a local consumer, a renewable generator (wind turbine) and a storage facility (battery), connected to the external grid via a transformer. We propose a 2 steps-ahead reinforcement learning algorithm to plan the battery scheduling, which plays a key role in the achievement of the consumer goals. The underlying framework is one of multi-criteria decision-making by an individual consumer who has the goals of increasing the utilization rate of the battery during high electricity demand (so as to decrease the electricity purchase from the external grid) and increasing the utilization rate of the wind turbine for local use (so as to increase the consumer independence from the external grid). Predictions of available wind power feed the reinforcement learning algorithm for selecting the optimal battery scheduling actions. The embedded learning mechanism allows to enhance the consumer knowledge about the optimal actions for battery scheduling under different time-dependent environmental conditions. The developed framework gives the capability to intelligent consumers to learn the stochastic environment and make use of the experience to select optimal energy management actions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The control strategy is based on the integration of optimal generation scheduling with a model predictive control in order to achieve both long and short-term optimal planning. In particular, long-term optimization of the various microgrid components is obtained by the adoption of an optimal generation scheduling, in which a statistical approach is used to take into account weather and load forecasting uncertainties. The real-time management of the microgrid is instead entrusted to a model predictive controller, which has the important feature of using the results obtained by the optimal generation scheduling. The proposed control strategy was tested in a laboratory-scale microgrid present at the University of Seville, which is composed of an electronic power source that emulates a photovoltaic system, a battery bank and a hydrogen production and storage system. Two different experimental tests that simulate a summer and a winter day were carried out over a 24-h period to verify the reliability and performance enhancement of the control system. Results show an effective improvement in performance in terms of reduction of the microgrid operating cost and greater involvement of the hydrogen storage system for the maintenance of a spinning reserve in batteries.},

Consequently, the prediction of power produced from these plants is fundamental for the reliability, safety and stability of the grid. This paper compares three physical models describing the PV cell (corresponding to three-, four- and five-parameter equivalent electric circuit) and two thermal models for the cell temperature estimation (NOCT and Sandia). The models were calibrated and tested towards ten monocrystalline and eight polycrystalline modules installed at SolarTechLab at Politecnico di Milano. The hourly error of the forecasted power output is usually lower than 15Wh, while NMAE{\textless}inf{\textgreater}{\%}{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and WMAE{\textless}inf{\textgreater}{\%}{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} are in the range of 0.5{\%} and 10{\%}. Low errors, calculated with actual weather conditions, suggest that the implemented models are accurate, but they cannot be directly compared with other approaches which adopt weather forecasts. Results show that there is no clear advantage of using complex models, but the data used for the model calibration mostly affect the model accuracy. It was found that forecasted power output are more accurate using experimental data and Sandia's thermal model in monocrystalline cells type, while for the polycrystalline the data from the manufacturer and NOCT have lower errors.},

However, multi-energy analyses in remote areas are hindered by a lack of models allowing for the generation of multi-energy load profiles based on interview-based information characterised by high uncertainty. This study proposes a novel open-source bottom-up stochastic model specifically conceived for the generation of multi-energy loads for systems located in remote areas. The model is tested and validated against data obtained from a real system, showing a very good approximation of measured profiles, with percentage errors consistently below 2{\%} for all the selected indicators, and an improved accuracy compared to existing approaches. In particular, some innovative features – such as the possibility to define and modulate throughout the day appliances' duty cycles – seem to be determinant in marking a difference with previous approaches. This might arguably be even more beneficial for case studies characterised by a larger penetration of appliances that are subject to complex and unpredictable duty cycle behaviour.},

In this paper, we answer all these questions affirmatively. In particular, we first show that the recent DQN algorithm, which combines Q-learning with a deep neural network, suffers from substantial overestimations in some games in the Atari 2600 domain. We then show that the idea behind the Double Q-learning algorithm, which was introduced in a tabular setting, can be generalized to work with large-scale function approximation. We propose a specific adaptation to the DQN algorithm and show that the resulting algorithm not only reduces the observed overestimations, as hypothesized, but that this also leads to much better performance on several games.},

	abstract = {The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account, deeply rooted in psychological and neuroscientific perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks.},

@article{Schulman2017,
	abstract = {We propose a new family of policy gradient methods for reinforcement learning, which alternate between sampling data through interaction with the environment, and optimizing a "surrogate" objective function using stochastic gradient ascent. Whereas standard policy gradient methods perform one gradient update per data sample, we propose a novel objective function that enables multiple epochs of minibatch updates. The new methods, which we call proximal policy optimization (PPO), have some of the benefits of trust region policy optimization (TRPO), but they are much simpler to implement, more general, and have better sample complexity (empirically). Our experiments test PPO on a collection of benchmark tasks, including simulated robotic locomotion and Atari game playing, and we show that PPO outperforms other online policy gradient methods, and overall strikes a favorable balance between sample complexity, simplicity, and wall-time.},

@article{Balderrama2019,
	abstract = {Efforts towards ensuring clean and affordable electricity for all have been progressing slowly in rural, off grid areas of developing countries. In this context, hybrid microgrids may offer reliable and potentially clean electricity for isolated locations. Nevertheless, the process of planning and operation of these systems faces several challenges, often due to the uncertainties related to the renewable resources and to the stochastic nature of electricity consumption in rural contexts. This paper tackles this problem and contributes to the literature in bridging the gap between field practices and two-stage stochastic modeling approaches by identifying an open-source modeling framework which is then applied to real local data. As reference case-study, we consider a microgrid built in 2015 in Bolivia. Overall, the optimal system results from a compromise between the Net Present Cost, the peak capacity installed and the flexibility (to balance variable generation). Different approaches to size isolated microgrids are tested, with the conclusion that methods accounting for the uncertainty in both demand and renewable generation may lead to a more robust configuration with little impacts on the final cost for the community.},
